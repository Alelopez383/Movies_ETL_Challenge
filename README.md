# Movies_ETL_Challenge
The streaming company Amazing Prime needs to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, for a hackathon. To do this, we will follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
